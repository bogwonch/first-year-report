annote = {Rewriter for Android apps to hook Android APIs.  Only modifies Java calls (classes.dex) and it does catch reflection calls (To what extent?  Always? What about calls when control flow is hijacked?)

Manages to keep keysigned data separation despite recompiling apps (No mention as to how they're doing this... presumably they're storing a table of signing keys, corresponding re-signing keys for each app they recompile)

High uptake in Germany (apparently).  Samsung interested in integrating it.

Monitors Java calls (from both Java and native code) but doesn't catch purely native code{\ldots} they cite a paper that says only 5% of apps use native code anyway (but what percentage of malware?)

Claim to help user organise permissions through the usual fine-grained permissions arguments, but also aim to be able to prevent malware using a rootkit through monitoring 'Runtime.exec()'.

{\ldots}Which I think is a massive exaggeration.  If they can't hook native code why not put the exploit there?  Why not monitor the execve family of system calls ultimately doing the execution.  Also not all exploits require an execve or aim to pop a shell.  What about something that wants to disable selinux (only need a write syscall).  What about an exploit that is working through a driver bug.

Find it slightly worrying they offer a download of their apk to sideload without any form of authenticity checks (i.e. a signature),}
